# JS Group Test - Example
## Lore
A friend group collected the places they usually go to smell pretty flowers. Because the beauty of the flowers makes them dizzy, they tend to forget where they've been before, so they want to create a simple administration program to make their life easier.

## Starting code
```JS
[
    {
        place: 'City center, main park',
        flowersSmelled: 12,
        visitedBy: ['Steve', 'David', 'Christopher']
    },
    {
        place: 'River island',
        flowersSmelled: 27,
        visitedBy: ['Laure', 'Christopher', 'Patrick', 'Orsy']
    },
    {
        place: 'Steve\'s apartment',
        flowersSmelled: 4,
        visitedBy: ['Steve', 'Victor']
    },
    {
        place: 'Univeristy Campus',
        flowersSmelled: 43,
        visitedBy: ['Steve', 'David', 'Christopher', 'Laure', 'Orsy', 'Patrick', 'Victor']
    },
    {
        place: 'Public Library',
        flowersSmelled: 2,
        visitedBy: ['Laure', 'Orsy']
    }
]
```
